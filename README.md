<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Github repository for Software Engineering Group 23 (2021)

COVID-19 has brought the world into a deep financial and health crisis. With the number of cases rising daily, it becomes increasingly difficult to test and diagnose the virus efficiently and effectively. The purpose of this system is to make the diagnosis of COVID-19 a lot quicker and easier. This can be achieved with the help of modern technologies such as machine learning and deep learning. A number of datasets have been made public over the duration of this pandemic. These datasets consist of various X-rays, some of which test positive for COVID-19 and others negative. This project uses a concatenation of some of these datasets to train a Convolutional Neural Networks model. Once trained, this model has the potential to predict the presence of COVID-19 on X-ray scans.

### Built With

* Microsoft Azure
* Python
* TensorFlow
* Keras
* sciKit Learn
<!-- * scope to add more in future
* []() -->



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

You need to have access to Microsoft Azure.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/hamza-mughees/Microsoft-Detecting-COVID-19.git
   ```
2. Run the script 



<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage 

The intention of this project is to detect the presence of COVID-19 in X-Ray images of lungs.
It works by passing an X-Ray image of lungs through our trained convolutional neural network, them the CNN will out put a positive/ negative result, Alongside the % confidence.
